__A JOURNAL OF A PYTHON LEARNER__

_Main Reference: Learn Python 3 the Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw_

Hi, I’m Kit Hernandez, I’m taking a leap into the wonderful world of coding. Starting out 
the path into the Python universe. This is my learning journal as I go beyond this road. 
Hoping this would be useful to some who are also just starting out to embark into the same 
journey I am taking.

_To anyone reading this:_

This journal is useful to absolute beginners who are interested to learn python.

I didn't include the installation set-up of Python and Text Editor since it can be easily googled.
To save you some time, here's the link to Python Official Site: https://www.python.org/downloads/

YouTube has a lot of tutorials on setting up Python. Also, it is much needed to grab the knowledge
on how to run Python scripts in the terminal depending on your machine's operating system. There's 
also a lot of guides out there.

So if you're good to go. Feel free to hop in!
