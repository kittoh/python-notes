A JOURNAL OF A PYTHON LEARNER
Main Reference: Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw

Hi, I’m Kit Hernandez, I’m taking a leap into the wonderful world of coding. Starting out 
the path into the Python universe. This is my learning journal as I go beyond this road. 
Hoping this would be useful to some who are also just starting out to embark into the same 
journey I am taking.

To anyone reading this:

This journal is useful to absolute beginners who are interested to learn python.
